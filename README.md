# Moderator for Discord

CodeMod Bot is a bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) that allows moderators and members to use the server to its full potential. Members can request various information from the CodeMod Bot. To the user, the entire process happens on the server channels. There are some exception commands that we'll cover later in the docs.
